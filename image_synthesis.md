##Papers##

[The most famous Johnson's paper - Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer
and Super-Resolution](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/papers/eccv16/JohnsonECCV16.pdf) The transformation network follows the paper 

[DCGAN - UNSUPERVISED REPRESENTATION LEARNING WITH DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434v2.pdf)

[lengsrom faste neural style transfer - tensorflow](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer) 
Our implementation is based off of a combination of Gatys' A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style, Johnson's Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution, and Ulyanov's Instance Normalization.
